//class = a container for related functions
//Every java program should have atleast have one class that contains the main function
//When a function belongs to a class it is called a method
//public = access
public class Main {
    // void = reserve keyword
    // main = entry point of function
    // parenthess = parameters
    // curly braces = executed function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //String is like a variable that is equal to whatever you put
        String x = "Test";
        //Will print out whats in the parenthess
        System.out.println(x);
    }
